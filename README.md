# Klasifikasi Beras Pulen Pera

In This Repository, I shared this project about Rice Texture Classification. This project is a final project for my bachelor's degree. 
I am using a Transfer Learning method using InceptionV3 with the Datasets that I gather by myself. 
This project is based on Android Application made using Kotlin and Android Studio. 
You can see the process of making the ML inside the Machine Learning Model folder from start to finish.

I have removed the .tflite model from the project, if you want to use the application, you need to make a .tflite model first using the code inside Machine Learning Model folder.
